					Description:
				
				
					Define a class for a type called Fraction. This class is
  used to represent a ratio of two integers. Include mutator functions that
  allow the user to set the numerator and the denominator. Also include a
  member function that returns the value of the numerator divided by the
  denominator as a double&#44; but if the
  value can only represent by an integer&#44; then it should be represented integer.
  Include an additional member function that outputs the value of the fraction
  reduced to lowest terms. For example&#44; instead of outputting 20/60 the
  function should output 1/3. This will require finding the greatest common
  divisor for the numerator and denominator&#44; and then dividing both by that
  number. embed your class in a test program.

					No input.
				
				
					Output:
				
				
					As following sample.

					■ Eazy&#44;Only basic programming syntax and structure
  are required.
				
				
					□ Medium&#44;Multiple programming grammars and structures
  are required.
				
				
					□ Hard&#44;Need to use multiple program structures or
  more complex data types.
