					Description: 
				
				
					Consider a text file named scores.txt that contains player
  scores for a game. A possible sample is shown next where Ronaldo’s best score
  is 10400&#44; Didier’s best score is 9800&#44; etc. Put at least five names and
  scores in the file. 
				
				
					 
				
				
					Ronaldo 
				
				
					10400 
				
				
					Didier 
				
				
					9800 
				
				
					Pele 
				
				
					12300 
				
				
					Kaka 
				
				
					8400 
				
				
					Cristiano 
				
				
					8000 
				
				
					 
				
				
					Write a function named getHighScores that takes two array
  parameters&#44; an array of strings and an array of integers. The function should
  scan through the file and set the string array entry at index 0 to the name
  of the player with the highest score and set the integer array entry at index
  0 to the score of the player with the highest score. The string array entry
  at index 1 should be set to the name of the player with the second highest
  score and the integer array entry at index 1 should be set to the score of
  the player with the second highest score. Do the same for the entries at
  index 2. Together&#44; these two arrays give you the names and scores of the top
  three players. In your main function&#44; test the getHighScores function by
  calling it and outputting the top three players and scores. 
				
				
					Input: 
				
				
					Given an input
  file “scores.txt” which contains player’s scores for a game. 
				
				
					Output: 
				
				
					Output the names
  and scores of top three players.

					■ Eazy&#44;Only basic programming syntax and structure
  are required. 
				
				
					□ Medium&#44;Multiple programming grammars and structures
  are required. 
				
				
					□ Hard&#44;Need to use multiple program structures or
  more complex data types. 
				
			
		
		
			
				
					Expected solving time: 
				
				
					20minutes 
				
			
		
		
			
				
					Other notes: 
				
				
					(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scores.txt的檔案內容如下: 
				
				
					Ronaldo 
				
				
					10400 
				
				
					Didier 
				
				
					9800 
				
				
					Pele 
				
				
					12300 
				
				
					Kaka 
				
				
					8400 
				
				
					Cristiano 
				
				
					8000 
				
				
					 
				
				
					(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 此題需要定義一個getHighScores的function&#44; 然後有兩個參數分別是array of strings 和 an array of integers。此方法需要讀取檔案內的所有資料並找出分數高的前三名的名字和分數&#44; 並在main裡呼叫getHighScores然後輸出分數高的前三名的名字和分數 
				
				
					(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 此題不用考慮同分的情況
